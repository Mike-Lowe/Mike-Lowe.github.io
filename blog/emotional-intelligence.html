      My Reflections: Mindfulness 
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

    </h2>  
    
      
     <p> I defintely have a bias for. I have been practicing mindfulness in various forms for a long time. Having said that though, it's often a practice whereby I have to consciously make myself do it. It's a bit like exercise, I have to remind myself of how I feel afterwards. 
      Tasks tend to be my main focus and I want to just jump straight in and begin. So I also have to tell myself that to practice my mindfulness will actually aid me in my tasks.
    </p>
      
      <h2>How did you find the overall experience?</h2>
       
      <p>
      Very pleasant and helpful. I have one breathing exercise meditation that I practice and I figured that was enough. The exercise showed me that i can have multiple and the benefits are worth it.</p> 
      
      <h2> What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?</h2>
      
     <p>
      
      I am committing to practicing mindfulness every morning before I begin my day's work at my work station.</p>
          
      
      
      
      <h1>Listening and Looping</h1>
       
      <h2>What was it like to be fully listened to?</h2>
       
      <p>
      It's always a little disconcerting, like you're doing a performance. You want to do it perfectly and if you lose focus or go off on a tangent, it can shake your sense of what you're trying to get across.</p> 
      <h2>   What was it like to fully listen?</h2>
   
      <p>
       A good experience and something that I actively work on anyway. I'm wary though of taking mental notes as I go. I found that if I just listened without any internal monlogue, I was actually able to recall those parts more accurately.</p>
