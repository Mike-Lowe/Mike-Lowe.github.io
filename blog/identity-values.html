      <p>
        Sometimes you come to a crossroads in your life. For me it was at the start of this year when I was involved in covering the parliamentary occupation protests as a news camera operator. For all involved in the media (as well as politicians, police, local residents and business owners) this event became a very intimidating and stressful ordeal. As media, you often find yourself immersed in situations that are unpredictable and risky and you do so willingly on most occasions. 
        </p>
        <p>There have been many times during my career as a cameraman that I felt I was being morally and ethically challenged. Situations where you force yourself into people’s lives or space is unfortunately a reality of the modern media experience. I never felt comfortable with the ruthless pursuit of people, whether it be justified or not.
        During the parliamentary occupation this lens was turned back on the media and we didn’t like it. 
      </p>

    <p>Was it justified? In some aspects , yes. In particular, the parliamentary press gallery can resemble a pack of hungry dogs. Relentlessly pursuing their prey until there are only scraps left. This might sound overly dramatic, but I have seen many people fall victim to their uncompromising tactics over the years and it has never sat well with me. They justify their approach as being necessary for the pursuit of truth. But there are other ways to seek truth. You don’t have to chase a person down the road to gain truth. You don’t have to hound them until they have a breakdown.</p> 
    </p>   
    <p> 
    In reality their methods are employed in view of a ravenous media machine that is at war with itself over ratings and website clicks. Many times I’ve regarded them with derision, but then I’d realise that I was there with them doing the exact same thing. And that is a very uncomfortable ethical situation to be in. 
      </p>
      
     <p>
      Now I look back, I don’t blame them for acting they way they do because it’s an expectation forced upon them by the culture of their working environment and by the reality of what modern media companies expect from employees.  
      The parliamentary occupation was something that none of us had really encountered before. Sure, it was obvious in the wake of Trump that there was a new stake in, and appetite for, vilifying the media, but I’d never seen the level of hate and vitriol that I encountered during this time.</p> 
       <p>
      I had taken many risks for my job and the company over the years. More than I can count or remember. So the ethical decision I was faced with was this -  Do I now risk my personal safety for something that I no longer believe in? The answer was no.</p>
      <p> 
      With all decisions like this, there comes an inherent dilemma. I’ve always been someone who values loyalty and I’ve always stood up for my teammates, in any job I’ve ever had. The thought of leaving my team at such a critical and vulnerable time was something that weighed very heavily on me. I was one of the more experienced operators by this stage and I knew that people looked to me for leadership and guidance.</p>
      <p>
      However, I decided that the needs of my family and mental health were greater. I have two young children and as such was keenly aware of having people who relied on me. There seemed to be a wilful disregard from my colleagues as to what were the potential dangers of going out into a riot. I’ve trained in combat sports most of my adult life and I know what it feels like to get hit. And also the potential long term effects of that. And this was an unpredictable, dangerous environment scattered with violent people who were actively targeting the media and were further emboldened by the diet of misinformation they were consuming.</p> 
      <p>
      So it became a no-brainer for me. I was done.</p>
      
      <p>
      Coming home on that first day was really tough. It’s a big decision to walk away from a job you’ve done for seventeen years and a steady income, particularly when you have a family to support. My wife was amazing. She used to work with me as a journalist so she new the realities of the job and after we’d talked for a bit I realised that I was just really burnt out.</p>
      <p>
      I’d been asking things of myself that I wasn’t comfortable with for a long time and it had got to the point where it was unsustainable. 
      And within this, I knew I was capable of more than what this job asked of me. I was very much ensconced in a comfort zone and realised for some time that if I was really honest with myself, I was actually better at my job five years ago than I was now.</p>

      <p>
      Reflecting on the decision, I see that it was the best thing I could’ve done. It’s easy in life to blame others or your workplace for your problems. The problem was me. I wasn’t prepared to do what the job asked of me anymore and the best thing I could do was to leave.</p>
      <p>
      I’d listened to so many friends and colleagues over the years bitch and moan about the job, while just remaining and not doing anything about it. It becomes a comfortable bitterness that you find yourself reclining in. And it does nothing but isolate yourself from your colleagues and erode your sense of self worth.</p> 
      <p>
      I can honestly say that this year has been one of the best of my life. After leaving TVNZ I was contacted by an ex-colleague who runs a media training business, so I worked for her until the dev course started. Her other employees are all ex-news and current affairs journalists, some of whom I knew. It became gratifying to discover that we were all connected by our experiences and reasons for leaving the industry.</p>
      <P>
      It was great because it was an opportunity to educate people on how to cope with media demands, and therefore all those difficult experiences that I’d gone through became filtered through a lens of clarity and value. 
      Another realisation also hit me. And that I was thoroughly sick of the media. The face that this course was on the horizon was always such a beacon of hope for me and now I’m in it I know I’m doing the right thing. 
    </P>

      <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
      
      <p>
      I lost my father to cancer when I was eighteen. But his wonderful inquiring mind, great humour and love of life still guide me today. 
      I’ve often mused on the idea that dead people can be more influential that ones who are alive. I guess it’s because we elevate them to a position that they wouldn’t have attained had they lived. 
      In any case, my Mum and Dad always encouraged me to be a free thinker and to be creative and instilled in me a good work ethic. 
      These days, I must say it’s my wife who influences me most. She is strong, beautiful, hard working, exceptionally competent and loyal and I often look to her as a template of what I want to achieve.</p>
      
      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

      </h2>

      <p>My main strengths are that I care about people and am determined and flexible. 
      I believe it’s always important to care about those around you, even if it’s like the case in this course where you’ve just met people. I honestly believe it allows you to perform better because you present the best version of yourself. I’ve never enjoyed watching people fail and I get a lot of satisfaction out of helping people. I find I learn a lot during the process.</p>

      <p>Determination is not something that I’ve always had. It’s something I’ve had to foster and develop as the years have gone by. The best way to do this is to take on difficult things. This is part of the reason I wanted to do Dev, because I love testing myself. You see yourself more clearly and you can identify the bits that work and the what needs more work. 
     </p> 
      
      <p> My flexibility of thinking is something that is also a strength. I like coming at a problem from a variety of angles and I’ve always been someone who’s questioned things and looked in a range of places for the answers.</p> 
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?

      </h2>
      

      <p>
      I’ve definitely been guilty in the past of drifting into comfort zones. Also, having a lack of direction. I’ve always been someone who has a wide range of interest topics. I love following a thread of information and seeing where it takes me. But there are downfalls to this mindset. This is something that I’m aware of as I progress. Staying on track and not going off into tangents or areas that are not relevant or that might cause overload or confusion.</p> 
      <h2>

      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>

        <p>
      In my previous career I was often in situations that were challenging. One such time was when I was with a team where we were required to potentially do multiple live crosses in a developing situation. The scenario is referred to as breaking news. It was in a remote location and the weather was bad. It was snowing and was very cold and miserable.</p>
      <p>
      I was there with a reporter and a guy who was responsible for setting up and maintaining the satellite link. He was very resistant to the situation from the outset . It was clear that he didn’t want to be there and couldn’t wait to leave. To be honest, I felt the same way, but there was a job to do and we had to do it. This guy had been in the job for a very long time and had struggled to adapt to the rapid changes in the industry.</p>
      <p>
      News had become very demanding and the immediacy of the content was what was valued most highly. 
      The relationship between him and reporter had devolved to the point where they were actively arguing with one another and I was caught in the middle. Her perspective was the correct one in that we had to do our job, but her manner was gruff and his was obstinate. When people become adversaries, logic and decorum flee the scene, so I was charged with trying to ease things.</p>
      <p>
        <p>
      I remember getting my set-up complete and then asking him if he needed help with anything. I’d known this guy from my first day on the job. He was very much from the old school and I knew that pressing another perspective on him wasn’t going to work, so I decided to try to take his mind from the conflict and back to the technical, which was his thing. I also talked to the reporter and sympathised with her point of view, but also stressed that it was a confusing and difficult situation for our colleague and that I would make sure that everything got done and that there wouldn’t be any problems with the technical side of things.</p>
      <p>
      I guess the strategy worked, because the arguing stopped. It would’ve been counter-productive if I’d taken a side as that would have encouraged the aggrieved party to further retreat into their defensive barrier. 
      What would I try now? I maybe could have gotten ahead of the situation a bit more. Both people were very headstrong individuals and I should’ve seen the conflict coming.</p>
      <p>
      I think making sure that the guy was aware of the nature of what was going on would’ve helped. I mean - he should’ve. It was his job to know and that’s very frustrating when you have a colleague who appears to be wilfully ignorant of the reality of a situation. But it often just comes down to fear. Fear that they won’t perform under difficult situations and that is then expressed as confusion or frustration.</p>
