      <h2>
        Career Pathway
      </h2>

      <p>
 At this stage my career path involves obtaining a junior developer job in one of the local tech companies. 
 I'm not too concerned about where that is at this stage, 
 I really just want to be able to be in a position where I can learn and then provide that company with useful service.</p> 
 <p>
 In terms of long term goals, a significant motivating factor in my life has always been my 
 interest in and love of the natural world. In that regard, I would like to become involved in the development of tools to aid 
 work in the area of environmental protection.
 I have an ambition of starting my own tech business in this area.</p> 
<h2>
Strengths and Limitations
</h2>

 <p>
  <p>My main strengths are that I care about people and am determined and flexible. 
   My limitations mostly involve around a lack of direction. 
   It's something I have to work hard on. Setting clear goals for the day really helps.   
 </p>  
 <h2>
  Development of Skills
 </h2>
 <p>
  I would like to see my team and collaboration skills develop while I'm at Dev. 
  I see them as good at this point, but there is defintely room for improvement. 
  Some of that could revolve around me being confident enough to provide leadership 
  when working on projects.  
 </p>
 <h2>
  Learning Commitment
 </h2>
 <p>
  I intend to manage myself around good time productivity. 
  Working to a time limitation and then taking timed breaks around that. 
  If and when things start to get overwhelming, 
  I will reach out to my facilitators and also make use of whanau love and support. 
 
 </p>
      <h2>
        Facilitation Team Expectations
      </h2>
      <p>
       I expect that I will have useful and professional instruction and support in this area.  
      </p>
<h2>
  Scheduling Information
</h2>
<p>
  There are no real block-out times I've committed to. 
  I have kids who attend daycare and school and have good whanau support arrangements 
  for pick-up and drop-off.
