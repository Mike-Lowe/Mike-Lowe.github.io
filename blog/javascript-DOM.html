  <h1>What is Javascript?</h1>
  

  <p>
  Imagine a cake. At first it's a bowl of ingredients. We could say that this is the <strong><em>html</em></strong>.</p> 
  <p>
  Then there are the decorations: The icing, the figures on top, the candles. 
  These are representations of <strong><em>CSS</em></strong>. The style that adds colour and character to the cake.</p>
  <p>
  But then there is the magical, unseen element that baked the cake and brought it to life.

  This is <strong><em>Javascript</em></strong>. 
  Javascript enlivens html elements like how heat acts as a catalyst in the baking process.
  No heat - no cake. No Javascript - no fully functioning website.

  What is Control Flow?

  </h1>

  <p>
    Your computer runs code from top to bottom and <strong><em>Control Flow </em></strong>is the expression of that behaviour. 
    What changes the direction of the control flow are things such as <strong><em>Loops</em></strong>, Conditionals, or Functions. 
  </p>  

  <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s62QZ.jpg" alt="control flowchart" class="flow-img">

  <h3>
  <em>
    As can be seen from the diagram above. Control flow follows a fundamentally simple pattern of logic.</em> 
      
  </h3>

  <p>
    To use a culinary example again - it is like making a meal. 
    There is a method to the preparation, but there are various recipes and ingredients within those recipes 
    that can be used before the final product 
    is served. 
  </p>

  <h1>
    Loops
  </h1>

  <p>  
    A <strong><em>loop</em></strong> is a tool that repeats a set of instructions. 
    It employs the term "iterate", which bascially means "repeat" and will occur until an outcome  
    (referred to as a stopping condition) is met.
  </p>

  <h3>

    <em>The above diagram represents what happens in a Javascript loop.</em> 
  </h3>

  <p>
    Below is a an illustration of a simple loop that outputs the numbers two through to five. 
    The "i" is a variable index followed by a condition that checks if "i" is less than or equal to five, 
    followed by the increment "++", which adds one to the operand "i".
  </p>

    <p>
      What does this mean? As in the first diagram, the equation will "loop" until the specified conditions are met.

  <h1>
    Arrays and Objects
  </h1>

  <p>
    Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data 
    (rather than just a single value). 
    
  </p>

  <h3>
    <em>The example above illustrates how dot notation accesses "key: value" attributes in  an object.</em>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Arrays are used to create lists of items in a single variable. 
    They are useful when creating ordered clusters of data that can then
    be referred to by their numerical position in the list.
  </p>

  <p> 
    Arrays employ zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, 
    the second item an index of 1, and so on.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <em>In the example above, the item 'apple' is indexed at position 2 in the array.</em>
    
  </h3>

  <h1>
    Functions
  </h1>

  <p>
    A function is a chunk of reusable code. It is designed to do a specific job. 

    A function is made up of of a group of information but produces a single statement.
  </p>

  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEU-uQr0mfZFhQrFKR6Gja71jGiOG5hjTX67XCMQOHWOjjY3g7uqQlVAu7iohjgZQlyTna-317rVXcREjJnBdWCxbKsq9qkKodSQYW5OkB95dwEKOAaicd6H7eAI1eJugwvMRje94SrxCHv0Fih5qe_7wg=w265-h106-no?authuser=0" alt="baldy" class="baldy">

  

  <h3>
    <em>In the example above, the function does nothing until it "called" outside the function parentheses</em>
    
  </h3>

  <p>
    Functions also employ "parameters" and "arguments" to produce a range of results. 

  </p>
