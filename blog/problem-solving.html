  <h4>
    What was the Problem?

  </h4>
  
  <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fizzbuzz:</strong> I became stuck on the first part of the challenge.
      
      </li>

  <h4>
    Problem-solving Techniques:
  </h4>

  <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I wrote out the sequence of how I should tackle the problem, 
        by breaking it down into its elemental parts.
      </li>  
      <li>
        <strong>Research:</strong> I researched online coding guides for an insight into a solution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reflection:</strong> I had a strong feeling that my solution and thinking was correct,
        yet I wasn't returning the correct result. I realised via the discord chat threads that I had 
        not understood the nature of the function parameter.
      </li>

    </ul>
     
  </div>

  <h4>
    How did I feel?
  </h4>
  <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Frustrated:</strong> I had over-thought the problem, which I have a tendency to do and it was 
        frustrating to see how simple the solution actually was.
      </li>  
      

    </ul>
     
  </div>
  <h4>
    What did I learn?
  </h4>

  <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>A lot:</strong> In going down the path I did, I coded a lot of wrong solutions, 
        but the process became very valuable as I was acquiring knowledge along the way. 
      </li>

  Solving Elegantly

 <h4>
  What was the Problem?
 </h4>

 <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>First Off:</strong> I want to state that I don't think I've actually solved anything 'elegantly'.
        It's almost exclusively been a process of scrapping and figthing my way towards an outcome. 
        Although in the last couple of challenges, I've found that I've been able to start reading the code. 
        What I mean by that, is that it's starting to make sense to me like understanding the elements in 
        a mathmatical equation eventually does.  
      </li>  
      <li>
        <strong>The Problem:</strong> The deBee challenge. I was pleased with how I came to the solution in the problem.
        It was something of a lightbulb moment, in fact. As I mentioned above, it was the moment I 
        really saw the code as something that could be separated into working parts; 
        <p>.split() was like taking something apart to examine it.

        </p>
        <p>
          .filter() was how I could study the parts and change, amend, or improve them.
        </p> 
        <p>
          .join() was putting them back together as a whole and then seeing if the function would work.
        </p>  
      </li>
      

    </ul>

    <h4>
      Problem-solving Techniques:
    </h4>
  
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Once again, writing out the sequence was really helpful. 
          
        </li>  
        <li>
          <strong>Research:</strong> Researching online.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Console log:</strong> Logging my results to the console was a helpful indication 
          of where I was going with the logic.
        </li>
  
      </ul>
       
    </div>
  
    <h4>
      How did I feel?
    </h4>
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tired, but Fortified:</strong> It was late friday afternoon when I finished this challenge and I was tired.
          Although I was satisfied with my work and especially with the fact that I felt I'd achieved an undertsanding breakthrough.
          I started to think that what seemed impossible was starting to seem possible.  
        </li>  
        
  
      </ul>
       
    </div>
    <h4>
      What did I learn?
    </h4>
  
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Belief:</strong> The work I've been putting in felt like it was paying dividends. 
          Even though I don't feel like I'm anywhere near where I want to be, 
          it was a gratifying experience to finish this challenge.   
        </li>

      <h2>Reflections on Techniques
        
      </h2>

      <div class="mirror">ðŸªž</div>


      <div class="list">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Confident with this mechanism as I can see its benefit.  
          </li>  
          <li>
            <strong>Trying something:</strong> I do this a lot. Am I confident with the process?
            I'm not sure. I'm confident to use it, but rarely confident that it will work.  
          </li>  
          <li>
            <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I haven't really used it yet. I've been thinking on it though.  
          </li>  
          <li>
            <strong>Reading Error Messages:</strong> This has been an eye-opener for me. It's a technique I've
            had to work on, but I've found it to be useful and interesting.  
          </li>  
          <li>
            <strong>Console.logging:</strong> It took me a while to understand the benefit of this,
            but now I use it regularly.  
          </li>  
          <li>
            <strong>Googling:</strong> I do this a lot. Sometimes maybe too much.   
          </li>  
          <li>
            <strong>Asking peers for help:</strong> I've reached out a few times, but should do more.
            Often though, I see that the problem I'm facing has already been expressed by someone and there's 
            a thread of advice to follow. 
          </li>  
          <li>
            <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> I'll only do this when I'm really stuck badly. Although I 
            intend to start jumping into the co-working spaces if a coach is doing a session.  
          </li>  
          <li>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> This can sometimes seem a bit of a drag, because it's always last on the list
            of the week's activities. But it is always really valuable as it allows me to shine a light on what I'm pleased with and 
            what I've got to work on.  
          </li>
