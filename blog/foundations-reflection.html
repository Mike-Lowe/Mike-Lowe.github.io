     <h2>
      Three things I've learnt about myself with Core Learning

     </h2>  
     <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Belief:</strong> 
          <p>
            This is something that I realise is going to be an ongoing
            process for me during this course. When I hit a problem that seems insurmountable, I 
            start to question whether or not I'm good enough, or that I belong in this area of endevour.
            I've never liked it when something hasn't come to me easily and this definitely has not.
            But belief comes via determination and work, as well as learning to work more efficiently. 
            I realise that I may be lagging behind in some areas, but I plan to put in the hours 
            and use the resources available and finish strongly.   
          </p>  

        </li>  
        <li>
          <strong>Mindfulness:</strong> 
          <p>
            It's fine to practice relaxation and mindfulness when I'm
            already relaxed and relatively stress-free. It's another thing entirely when the screws are being applied
            and I'm in the midst of something very stressful and challenging. I have to remind myself that practicing mindfulness is 
            a really important part of the day. This is difficult when I see how much needs to be done and the time in which I have  
            to do it. But I am doing it and it does help. I've come to see that planning and writing 
            out my goals for the day has been beneficial. I've also written down some mantras that I look at periodically
            through the day. The most helpful is the idea that stress is an impediment. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vulnerability:</strong> 
          <p>
            That I am someone who has weaknesses and vulnerabilites, despite my best efforts to cover them.
            That these vulnerabilities are a strength and that I can learn a lot from them and use them to become
            more empathetic towards others. 
          </p>  
        </li>
  
      </ul>
       
    </div>
      
      <h2>The Role of Empathy, Self-Awareness and Learning in Programming</h2>

      <div class="list">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Empathy:</strong> 
            <p>
              I think these principles are important to all parts of life. In terms of empathy in programming - you're part  
              of a team. So empathy goes a long way towards strengthening the bonds between people on that team.
              Even just asking someone how they're going or if they're ok, is a good way to foster empathy.
              They may or may not want to talk or have much to talk about, but the fact that you took an interest 
              in them is the relevant factor. 
               
            </p>  
  
          </li>  
          <li>
            <strong>Self-Awareness:</strong> 
            <p>
              What is the meaning of self-awareness? I see it as a process, not a destination. It can come in so many forms,
              but in terms of programming, it's being aware of your strengths as well as where you can improve. It's not being 
              afraid to admit that you are struggling with something.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Learning:</strong> 
            <p>
              This is a critical factor. I see programming as an area where I will constantly learn. By it's nature, 
              programming is fundamentally linked to the idea of progress. I think having a learning mindset 
              helps me in all areas of life, in as much as enjoyment, than anything. But with regards to programming it 
              seems especially relevant. What I mean by this is that discoveries and applications of technology 
              seem to be gaining in momentum, so a learning mindset is fundamental to keeping pace.    
            </p>  
          </li>
    
        </ul>
         
      </div>
       
      
      
      <h2> What has surprised me most about Core Learning?</h2>

      
     <p>
      
      The value of reflection. I've come to see that reflection is a powerful tool that can be used
      to boost productivity as well as the learning experience. 
     </p>
        
       
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of Core Learning?</h2>
       
      <p>
        Having to acknowledge my struggles. Having to do this  in written form at the end of the day, 
        when you'd spent an entire day going through them seemed a step too far. But it was in fact, the opposite.
        Writing about what I was going through helped me focus on what I needed to achieve, as well as putting 
        things in perspective. 
      </p> 
      
      <h2>Why spend so much time on Core Learning?</h2>
   
      <p>
        I would think that it's because emotional intelligence is being recognised as a core requirement and 
        developmental tool across all industries. It therefore stands to reason that it increases your ability to obtain a job, as well as 
        progress in your career. Speaking from my own experience so far, Foundations has challenged me emotionally
        as much as it has intellectually. It seems as though this is only going to increase with the bootcamp workload, 
        so it's important that a person develops an awareness of their own core values and mechanisms to help 
        them through the constant
        challenges.  
        
      </p>

      <h2>Is Core Learning a waste of time?</h2>

      <p>
        The exact opposite. I've worked in a lot of different jobs with a lot of different people. 
        In some cases,
        I was trained very much in the old school manner and it taught me as much about what not to do, as what to do. 
        The majority of workplaces never had any institutionalised systems of wellbeing and core intelligence and as such 
        these concepts were never recognised as a fundamentally important element
        of the workplace. 
      </p>  
        
        <p>
          I've seen how core learning was only previously confined to the individual. 
          It used to just come down to the person. Was your boss or 
          their boss aware of you as a person who had feelings and emotions? Or were you just a work unit? 
          I only see it as something that can benefit a person or workplace. Some people may not see it the same 
          way and that's fine. Everyone is different and sees the world their way. But I have to say in my case,
          I saw things that way once too and it was only when I ran into significant difficulties that I started to 
          see the relevance and benefit of core learning.
