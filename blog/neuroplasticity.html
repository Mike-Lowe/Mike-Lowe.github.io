        How does Neuroplasticity benefit people? 

      </h2>  
    
      
      <p> 
        I'm thinking of a pipe being unblocked. The stuff that blocks the pipe
        is all my learning pre-conceptions. What I'm good at. What I'm not.
        The principles of Neuroplasticity help me think about what those biases
        are actually based upon. Past 'failures'. High school. University. Childhood. 
        Experiences where you came up against something that made you feel you weren't
        good enough.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Engaging with Neuroplasticity</h2>
       
      <p>
        <strong>Meditation:</strong>
        This takes you inside your brain, in effect. 
        It allows you to step away from yourself in a number of ways and 'see' yourself with more clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Not taking shortcuts:</strong> Seeing a task through and reflecting properly upon it. 
          I tend to want to race ahead and this in itself causes anxiety, a by-product of which is under-performing.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Regular Exercise:</strong> This benefits both my physical and mental health.
      </p>

         
      
      <h2>Ways to improve Neuroplasticity</h2>
      
      <p> 
        <strong>Positive Mindset:</strong> Be grateful for the things I have 
        and don't reflect on the things I don't.
        This way I bring my mind away from the abstract and into the real.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Slowing Down:</strong>
      
        Being present to what I'm doing is very helpful.
        This is a skill that requires constant review and application, 
        but it's actually not that hard.  
      </p>

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
       
      <p>
       <strong>Belief:</strong> That I can do better. Also, that effort is the key to achieving success
       and not some in-built vector of intelligence or talent. 
      </p> 
      
      <h2>Surprises</h2>
   
      <p>
        <strong>Fixed Mindset:</strong> I've believed in Neuroplasticity for a long time and find the principle
        fascinating, but there's always room for more reflection.
        So looking at even trivial areas in my life where I apply a fixed midset is helpful. 
      </p> 

      <h2>Integration</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Enjoy:</strong> A lot of this has been mentioned above. Belief in my abilities is a big one.
        This allows me scope to relax and enjoy.
