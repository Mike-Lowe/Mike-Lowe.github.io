  <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>
I live in Upper Hutt with my wife and two young children and am currently studying at <a target="_blank" href="https://devacademy.co.nz/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwguGYBhDRARIsAHgRm48reQm4yLSTiO5JQdC5g0uyTstXHL2D4EjXNT7kzPiXTYb1_C9vg_8aApCUEALw_wcB"> Enspiral Dev Academy</a> after spending 17 years in the media.

    </p>
    <p>
      The background image I chose for this page is a painting by one of my favourite artists, Henri Rousseau. 
      What I especially love is how it illustrates momentum. Everything in the painting seems to be drawing your eye towards something. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The spectre of the tiger seems especially relevant to me at the moment. 
      It is the very embodiment of strength, yet it's face seems to communicate 
      a sense of fear, anticipation and almost panic. 
      
    </p>

    <p>

      Whenever I've attempted something difficult in life,
      I've always felt a mixture of courage and trepidation. 

      It's with these qualities in mind that I'm undertaking this challenge at Dev Academy.
